## Overview of the Surfs_up challenge
The goal of this project is to create a more efficient method for analyzing the temperature trends on Oahu, Hawaii, by utilizing Advanced Data Storage and Retrieval (ADR). A prospective surf and ice cream shop business wanted to know if it could maintain a profitable business year-round, not just seasonal, by requesting statistics of data on temperature for June and December.

## Results
the retrieving data from June month showed that the temperature fluctuated between 64 and 85 75 째F, while in December,  the temperature changed within the range of  56-83 째F. the average temperature in June and December were 75 and 71 째F, respectively.

              #### Figure 1. Statistical Analysis of Temperature Changes in June

As shown by the histogram images, during these months, most of the days had temperature closed to the average temperature. Additionally, no dramatic change was observed between these two months, as there was only 4 째F difference in the average temperature of these months. 

## Summary
the analysis revealed that temperatures are relatively similar between June and December according to the weather patterns. Temperature data for either month do not appear to be strongly skewed. The data supports opening a Surf and Ice Cream shop year-round.
